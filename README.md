# personal-website

This is my personal website. If you are interested, you can run it locally.
Just clone the repo and make sure `stack` is installed. Then, just run:

```
stack build
stack run
```

from the project's root. Modify app/Main.hs, replacing 80 with 3000 so
that the server runs on localhost. Opening a browser and typing localhost:3000
in the search bar will show the website.
