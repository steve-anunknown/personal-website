# personal-website

This is my personal website. It's not hosted anywhere. If you are interested,
you can run it locally. The easiest way to do that, is by having Haskell's
`stack` installed. If you do, then running:

```
stack build
stack run
```

from the project's root will start a localhost server on port 3000. Opening a
browser and searching for `localhost:3000` will then allow you to browse the
website.
