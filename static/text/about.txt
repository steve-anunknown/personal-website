I am studying Computer Science in the School of Electric and Computer
Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens. I am mainly interested
in Computer Systems and Software Engineering, specifically in the fields of
Programming Language Design, Compiler Construction and Software Testing.

At the moment, I am working on my diploma thesis, concerning efficient
implementation of equivalence oracles in active automata learning algorithms.
In addition, I am a working student as a Software Developer in Nokia.
