        <p> I am studying Computer Science in the School of Electric and Computer
            Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens. I am mainly
            interested in Computer Systems and Software Engineering, specifically in the
            fields of Programming Language Design, Compiler Construction and Software
            Testing.

            At the moment, I am working on my diploma thesis, concerning efficient
            implementation of equivalence oracles (teachers) in <a

                target="_blank">
                active automata learning algorithms </a> . In addition, I am a working
            student as a Software Developer in Nokia.</p>
